## Description

My motivation for completing this project was to make the website more accessible. By completing this project I had made all of the html elements semantic, gave an easy to follow flow of structure, gave alt attributes to all images included, put the different heading into sequential order, and gave the title element a concise and descriptive title, which helped myself get more familiar with these topics.
